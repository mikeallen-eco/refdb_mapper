Arctophoca_australis	Arctocephalus australis	NA	NA	NA	MDD	MDD: has been moved to Arctophoca by a number of molecular studies using mtDNA, which found that Arctocephalus pusillus was not related to other members of the genus, but the paraphyly presented in earlier studies is likely a result of mitonuclear discordance and the genus Arctocephalus is now retained following recent studies using nuclear and mitochondrial markers; phyl uses Arctocephalus australis
Artibeus_watsoni	Dermanura watsoni	Dermanura incomitatus	NA	NA	MDD	watsoni includes incomitatus; moved to Dermanura from Artibeus, although some recent publications do not agree with this split, there seems to be more publications using this revised taxonomy rather than leaving all species under Artibeus
Cheracebus_torquatus	Callicebus torquatus	Callicebus purinus	NA	NA	MDD	moved from Callicebus to the recently described Cheracebus, although this arrangement is considered tentative, as some recent publications prefer to recognize Cheracebus and Plecturocebus as subgenera of Callicebus; purinus is now a synonym of C. torquatus since the type locality and specimen of C. torquatus was proven to be from populations previously attributed to C. purinus; thus, the species previously known as C. purinus is now known as C. torquatus
Heterogeomys_cherriei	Orthogeomys cherriei	Orthogeomys matagalpae	NA	NA	MDD	includes matagalpae; moved to Heterogeomys from Orthogeomys
